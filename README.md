# Birb Bot

## How?

```
go build
./birbbot -token $TOKEN
```

## Why?

Birbs

## TODOs

* cache pic list in memory instead of fetching every time
* update cached pic list periodically and/or when a pic is uploaded
* permissions instead of merely authorized accounts (ie account X can upload to object Y)
