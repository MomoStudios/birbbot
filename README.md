## TODOs

* cache pic list in memory instead of fetching every time
* update cached pic list periodically and/or when a pic is uploaded
* permissions instead of merely authorized accounts (ie account X can upload to object Y)
* Check file types of uploaded files instead of assumign its a jpg
* Support uploading / embedding videos (discord supports this)
